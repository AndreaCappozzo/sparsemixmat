# sparsemixmat

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of sparsemixmat is to provide a framework for matrix-variate data sparse model-based clustering. The approach assumes that the matrix mixture parameters are sparse and have different degree of sparsity across clusters, allowing to induce parsimony in a flexible manner. Estimation of the model relies on the maximization of a penalized likelihood, with specifically tailored group and graphical lasso penalties. 

This repository is associated with the paper Cappozzo, Casa, Fop (2023+) Sparse model-based clustering of three-way data via lasso-type penalties. FIXME ADD ARXIV LINK
